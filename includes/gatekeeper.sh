# In 10.8, Apple introduced something called "Gatekeeper," which is that
# annoying thing that will warn you when opening up an unsigned application in
# 10.8+. Since we can't rely on a user to have changed these settings, then we 
# might have to seek exceptions. This script checks to see if Gatekeeper will 
# deny an app from opening and ask permission if it will. Otherwise, it exits 
# with a hunky-dorey status.
